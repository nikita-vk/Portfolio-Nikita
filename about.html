            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p> Hello! My name is Nikita Kishan, and I am currently a rising senior at Boston University majoring in Biomedical Engineering
                with a concentration in ‘Technology of Innovation.’ My career aspirations involve leveraging my skills and passion for product 
                development, specifically within the MedTech industry, to enhance the quality of human life. <br>

                My interest in science and technology began during middle school, and mathematics quickly became my favorite subject in high 
                school and during my initial college years. Solving mathematical problems felt like piecing together a puzzle, with numerous 
                approaches to finding solutions. This fascination led me to choose Biomedical Engineering as my major. Through this stream of education,
                I can apply my creativity and logical thinking to create innovative technologies that can directly impact people’s lives, 
                and promote a higher quality of life. I am the type of person that enjoys serving other people, even in a position of leadership, I 
                always like to ensure that the work that I am doing is positively impacting the lives of other people and not just myself.
