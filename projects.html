                    <p>BreatheRight is a novel Biomedical Diagnostic Device that tracks inhaler medication usage, 
                        the user's pulmonary function, and also provides autonomous warnings for any incoming respiratory attacks.
                     Our mission was to find a convenient way to monitor
                        pulmonary function in people suffering from asthma to help them manage their respiratory illness better. We wanted 
                        to develop a device that was impactful in the long-run, specifically for disenfranchised communities to help reduce the financial burden
                        created by numerous emergency department visits and hospitalizations due to uncontrolled asthma. 
                         BreatheRight is what solidified my passion for product development
                        as I thoroughly enjoyed the entire process of developing the device, researching the market, and getting to meet and connect with such diverse
                        sets of people. We followed the Design Thinking Process to develop 
                        this device, and using this method we were able to develop a refined prototype that has impressed the judges and audience of two 
                        engineering competitions and MedTech industry partners enough to have received $3500 in awards. We have now entered our project 
                        to the prestigious 'NIH DEBUT competition' as well as the Medtronic 'BMES student Design competition.'

                    <p>My Friend and I developed a ping pong game on an FPGA using Verilog as part of a course (EC311- Introduction to Logic Design).

                        <li>The score increments each time the opponent misses the 'Ball' and the game continues until one of the players score total of three.</li>
                        <li>The speed of the ball increases as it is 'hit' from one side to another and if a player misses, the speed resets to its original speed</li>
                    </ol>
                    <br>
                    <p>Single-Player (squash mode) Game rules:</p>
                    <ol type="i">
                        <li>Player can click their button and the game will start</li>
                        <li>The score increments each time 'Ball' is 'hit'</li>
                        <li>The speed of the ball increases as it is 'hit' from one side to another and if a player misses, the score resets to zero</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>This was a very rewarding project which I enjoyed doing a lot because we were required to create a game on an FPGA with very little
                        introduction to verilog, we had to configure the seven segment LED display with no working knowledge of it, and we had a major time constraint.
                        This method of instruction is usually very beneficial for me because it allowed me to get as creative as possible and I was able to learn a new
                        programming language in a much quicker way.

            <p>A team of three other students and I developed user-friendly, detachable, rechargeable, and voice-controlled wheelchair lights that 
                automatically respond to the brightness of the environment and provide front/rear illumination for people with 
                mobility-related disabilities as part of a course (EK210- Introduction to Engineering Design). We were able to create 
                a working prototype which used 3 housing components, one for the 12V battery and the circuit, and the other two for front
                and rear illumination. The most difficult part was configuring the voice module but we managed to make it work and create a 
                fully functional device. The entire process was incredibly challenging but that is what made it so fun as it was my first time using 
                tinkering techniques, developing a circuit to actually create a functioning device, learning arduino code, and coming up with creative
                ways to overcome unexpected obstacles/bugs.

          <h3 class="ProjName">Truss Project</h3>
            <div class="Projdate"> November 2022 - December 2022 </div>
            <br>
            <p>
            My friend and I developed a Truss within strict cost, time, member length, and load constraints as part of a course project (Engineering mechanics I).
            Our Truss held up to 90 ounces before it began to buckle which is the highest load anyone's truss was able to hold (out of the entire engineering batch of 2025).
            we optimised our truss dimensions based on load, and tried to distribute the load across all of the compression joints as equally as possible. As part
            of the planning process, and as per the course requirements, I developed an analyzation tool to determine member forces, failure points, maximum load
            capacity, and cost ratio, using MATLAB for more efficiency. 
            The biggest constraint in regards to building the Truss was the minimum member length of 7 inches. Luckily, we ended up with a good load-to-cost ratio of $2.44 
            per ounce, and 0.409 oz per dollar. An important decision we made while designing the truss was to create an arch as we learned that this would allow 
            the truss to contain more members while also maintaining the required geometry. <a href="Truss_Prelim_Design.mlx" class="Truss-Code">Download MATLAB code</a>

                <h4>Personal Portfolio</h4>
                <div class="Projdate"> July 2024 - Present</div>
                <p>I wanted a place to document all my projects, work experiences, and course work. I also wanted
                    to learn how to build a website from scratch, design it, and make it interactive. So I built this
                website over the course of 1 and a half weeks by teaching myself HTML, CSS, and javaScript. This portfolio
                is definitely still a work in process in terms of the framework and design. I wanted to put all of my content 
                on this website before I began getting into the details of design and layout to make that process easier. Overall,
                it is a really fun process because I enjoy programming and learning new programming languages and design tools.
                I'm thinking out learning to use figma to create a better design for this portfolio. <span> <h5>Skills: HTML, CSS, JS.</h5></span>

            <h4>C/C++ Invoice Generator</h4>
            <div class="Projdate"> June 28th 2024</div>
            I wanted to brush up on my C/C++ skills before I began building my portfolio because I thought that 
            the transition from having a good working knowledge of C/C++ to learning javaScript would feel easier for me 
             and so I created an invoice generator for billing purposes without using any extra help from youtube or AI.
             Since the last time I used C/C++ was 3 years ago, it took a week for me to brush up on all the topics (from 
             basic syntax to Linked Lists). 
             <br>
             <p>The invoice generator has 3 functions: </p>
             <ol>
                <li>Generate an Invoice</li>
                <li>View all Invoices</li>

             using MATLAB and/or Python to analyze all of our data from these measurements.
