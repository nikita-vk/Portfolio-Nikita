            <h3>Biocon Biologics</h3>
            <h4>Quality Control Microbiology Laboratory Intern</h4>
            <p> For the first week  at this internship, I was trained on standard operating procedures (SOPs) of the laboratory, 
                collecting air and surface samples around production sites, performing Bacterial spread plating, 
                conducting MALDI/TOF based mass spectroscopy to identify the microbes, and conducting Bacterial Endotoxin Tests (BET) on the pharmaceuticals
                produced by Biocon Biologics (Insugen and Trastuzumab). After training, I shadowed the principal scientist for a few days before I was
                able to perform these tasks by myself. By the end of my internship, I collected 30+ samples to perform bacterial identification through 
                bacterial spread plating, gram staining, and mass spectroscopy. I was further trained in protein extraction from fungi 
                by observing the procedure for 100+ samples, membrane filtering techniques to test Water for Injection testing (WFI), sterility
                testing for injectable drugs, and injectables designing and other drug delivery device design at the R&D department. This internship was
                very fast paced and this made the experience very exciting because I was able to gain an incredible amount of skills  and knowledge in such a short duration
                of time. </p>

            <h3> Agganis Arena</h3>
            <h4>Operations Department Staff Supervisor</h4>
            <p>As a staff supervisor, I was responsible for conducting the staff to complete tasks in an 
                efficient and timely manner while also boosting team morale. I was responsible to complete tasks
                such as floor removal (convert the ice rink to a floor and vice versa), set up for major events such as 
                Cirque du Soleil, Disney on Ice, Ice hockey games, and concerts, cleaning up the arena after such events, 
                taking over customer service during holiday periods, and managing inventory. I was promoted from Operations Staff to Staff supervisor
                within three months of working there due to my reliability and work ethic. I really enjoyed working here because I got
                to interact with the most diverse range of people (because every event brought different types of people), learn
                how to lead different teams of people every other week, and learn how to conduct myself and other people in a professional manner.

            <h3> First-Year Student Outreach Project (FYSOP)</h3>
            <h4>Staff Leader</h4>
            <p>FYSOP, created by the Boston University Community Service Center, aims to inspire students 
                to become active community members through reflection and acts of service. Specifically 
                designed for incoming freshmen, I took on this role as a rising sophomore. My responsibilities 
                included fostering connections and friendships among the students on my team, boosting team 
                morale, organizing visits to community service centers, actively participating in service 
                activities, facilitating post-service reflections, and serving as a mentor throughout the year. 
                This incredible experience allowed me to volunteer at food shelters and medical centers, broadening my worldly 
                perspective while contributing to the diverse perspectives of my fellow students.
